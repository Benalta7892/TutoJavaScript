          Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head." When the
          lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two consenting adults. I've got to find a way to
          escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours.
          And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks. Now 'I'' have to pay ''them'!
        </p>
        <p>
          Okay, I like a challenge. What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is! ' My precious torso!
          <strong> Ah, yes!</strong> <em> John Quincy Adding Machine.</em> He struck a chord with the voters when he
          pledged not to go on a killing spree.
        </p>
        <h2>Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient?</h2>
        <p>
          You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing. We don't have a brig.
          Who are you, my warranty?! No, I'm Santa Claus!

          <li>
            Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or
            non-fatal?
          </li>
          <li>With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun!</li>
          <li>Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop, and he's an idiot! Well, that's love for you.</li>
        </ol>

        <input type="text" />

        <h3>Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here.</h3>
        <p>
          Daddy Bender, we're hungry. Perhaps, but perhaps your civilization is merely the sewer of an even greater
          society above you! Negative, bossy meat creature! A sexy mistake. Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all
          everybody else's fault!
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can.</li>
          <li>Take me to your leader!</li>
          <li>No, of course not. It was… uh… porno. Yeah, that's it.</li>
        </ul>

        <a href="#">aezaezeea</a>

        <p>
          It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too. But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. I never loved you.
          When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two consenting adults. I'll tell them you
          went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger.
        </p>
        <p>
          No, of course not. It was… uh… porno. Yeah, that's it. It's a T. It goes "tuh". Wow, you got that off the
          Internet? In my day, the Internet was only used to download pornography. Who are you, my warranty?!
        </p>
        <p>
          Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock. And why did 'I' have to take a cab? Shut up and get to the
          point! We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like
          clockwork, every three hours. And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks. Now 'I'' have to
          pay ''them'! Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species:
          fatal or non-fatal?
        </p>
        <p>
          These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I'll rest easier not knowing where they are. There's no
          part of that sentence I didn't like! Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on
          you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a
          pickpocket.
        </p>
        <p>
          Really?! With gusto. What kind of a father would I be if I said no? Please, Don-Bot… look into your hard
          drive, and open your mercy file!
        </p>
        <p>
          And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I, too, hope one day to go. The
          toilet. Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock. I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where
          it can fester quietly as a mental illness.
        </p>
        <p>
          We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised. Have you ever tried just turning off
          the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them? And I'm his friend Jesus. This is the worst part.
          The calm before the battle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Who are you, my warranty?! Bender, quit destroying the universe! Negative, bossy meat creature! I just told
          you! You've killed me! Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop, and he's an idiot! Well, that's love for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well made bed. You will practice until you can make your
          bed in your sleep. Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar.
        </p>
        <p>
          Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold the charge and the reception
          isn't very… I'm a thing. Throw her in the brig. Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to.
          $9.95 a minute.
